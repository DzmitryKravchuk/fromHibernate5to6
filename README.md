Migration from Hibernate 5 to 6 with JPA Criteria API
===
Hibernate ver.6 does not support it's own old Criteria API - it has been already deprecated in ver.5. Jakarta Persistence API has it's own classes, which are used in a different way. JPAâ€™s Criteria API in general is more verbose comparing to Hibernate's proprietary Criteria API though one can find plenty of information about appropriate ways for migration (eg. https://thorben-janssen.com/migration-criteria-api/). 

Anyway we can not just change package definition in import section in order to reuse the rest of existing code. We have to change implementation. Unfortunately for now it is impossible to make a complete picture of the usage of Hibernate Criteria API in the project (the given piece of code is not enough). That's why we are able to speak only about analysis on a pretty high level.

As usage of the deprecated Hibernate's Criteria API prevents us from upgrading the framework version, one of possible solutions is to make it in 3 steps.
 
###3 steps of migration:

1. If it is possible, to make unit tests for the functionality, which has to be modified (or make sure that we have tests). It's preferable to use TDD when we create tests based on existing interfaces, which will remain. Maybe we will need to refactor existing code to encapsulate particular implementation related to usage of deprecated API.
2. Create alternative implementation using JPA Criteria API. The tests created during step 1 will help us as well as analysis of hibernate logs for the Old and for the New implementation.
3. Move to the latest version of Hibernate using new implementation of Criteria API.

####The example of some simple JPA Criteria API which works fine for both 5 and 6 versions of Hibernate can be found in the `AppTest.class`, represents selection from DB the `Departments` which have `Employees` whose names start with the given string. JPA Criteria API has tools for much more complicated requests. But it is really hard to give any more accurate estimates and proposals on this project without a profound knowledge of the domain area and business processes.
